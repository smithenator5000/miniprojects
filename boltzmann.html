<h1>Boltzmann Verification</h1>
<h2>(feat. smithlin)</h2><hr/>
<h2> What? </h2>
The Maxwell-Boltzmann Distribution is a probability distribution which describes the distribution of molecular speeds in a gas at thermal equillibrium. This program verifies that an ideal gas settles to this distribution after its particles have undergone many collisions. It does this by randomly selecting particles to undergo a collision defined by a generalised vector equation. I used my own library, <a href="https://smithenator5000.github.io/smithlin"><strong>smithlin</strong></a> to help me make this program. Below is (hopefully) an animation created from the output. The blue line represents the theoretical distribution at a temperature of 70.1K, whilst the orange histogram shows the simulated distribution undergoing collisions after being initialised to a roughly uniform distribution.<br>

<h2> Why? </h2>
Whyever not?! Seriously, it's cool to see this piece of physics in action. Even if you initialise a gas to not follow the distribution, the gas will soon correct itself when left alone to do its thing. Mainly, I actually did this to get <strong> smithlin </strong> to do something useful. <hr/>
